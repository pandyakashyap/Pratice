                    Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 
                    SassScript is the scripting language itself.

                    <p>  CSS3 consists of a series of selectors and pseudo-selectors that group rules that apply to them. Sass (in the larger context of both syntaxes) extends CSS by providing several mechanisms available in more traditional programming languages, particularly object-oriented languages, but that are not available to CSS3 itself. When SassScript is interpreted, it creates blocks of CSS rules for various selectors as defined by the Sass file. The Sass interpreter translates SassScript into CSS. Alternatively, 
                        Sass can monitor the .sass or .scss file and translate it to an output .css file whenever the .sass or .scss file is saved.[3]

                    <p> Sass was initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum.[4][5] After its initial versions, 
                        Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein have continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a scripting language used in Sass files.</p>
